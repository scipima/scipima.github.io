    "section": "",
    "text": "Using data covering most European Union Member States, we study how the support for national governments has unravelled in the first months of the COVID pandemic. Motivated by the growing evidence on the uneven economic impact of this crisis across genders, we study if such unequal economic burden is related to differences in support for public authorities between men and women. While the support for national governments has overall faded in the period considered, the decline has been more pronounced for women and working women in particular. We find indication that the decline in support signals a shift in concerns among Europeans and women in particular, from the health emergency to the economic consequences of the pandemic. We impute up to a third of the widening gender gap in support for government to the shift of emphasis from the health to the economic dimension of the crisis.\n\nMazza, J., & Scipioni, M. (2023).

    "section": "",
    "text": "This report describes the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the European labour market for three groups in the resident population: natives, EU born, and non-EU born. Combining macroeconomic data on the main labour market indicators - activity rate, employment rate, unemployment rate - with the latest waves of the European Labour Force Survey, the study describes the responses of the European labour markets to the shock and its diverse effects across socio-demographic segments of the population. Focusing on the differential effect, the analysis finds that after a severe contraction for in 2020, especially for non-EU born workers, the macro indicators have returned close to their pre-pandemic trends. However, when considering specific socio-demographic groups in 2020, a sizeable gap becomes evident in the probability of job termination by origin. EU-born and non-EU born workers display probabilities between 25% and 125% higher than natives. Among the already underprivileged group of non-EU born workers, the main losers are the young with a short labour market history in the Union.\n\nMazza J., M. Scipioni and G.
