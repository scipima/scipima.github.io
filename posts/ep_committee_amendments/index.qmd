This repo collects data regarding MEPs' amendments in EP Committees. 
Once such amendments are collected, it provides convenience functions in both bash and R to count them as well as store the outputs.
[EP Amendments in Committees](https://github.com/scipima/ep_amendments_test) provides a series of function to gather and explore text data in both bash and R.
