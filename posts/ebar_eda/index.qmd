Here's the link to a [shiny app](http://nwf7y1-marco-scipioni.shinyapps.io/ebar_eda) that I created to quickly explore some key trends from Eurobarometer data.

The app is based on a [repo](https://github.com/scipima/eurobarometer_eda) that gathers and harmonises aggregated excel files for the Standard Eurobarometer.
The app also shows estimates of turnout intentions coming from the [EP Eurobarometer](https://europa.eu/eurobarometer/surveys/browse/all/ep) surveys.
