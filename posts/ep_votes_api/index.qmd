I set up a repo that collects votes in the European Parliament from the EP API. 
Check it here [EP votes](https://github.com/scipima/ep_vote_collect). 
It can be used in two different ways. 
First, the repo enables the collection of daily votes. 
Second, the repo also offers the codes to download and put in tabular format all votes for the current mandate available on the API.
