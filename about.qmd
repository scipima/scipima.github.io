I am a data scientist at the European Parliament, mainly working on vote analysis, public opinion, and election campaigns. Previously, I worked for the European Commission Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography.

I have a BA and MA in Philosophy and Ethics, an MSc and PhD in Politics, and a Graduate Certificate at Harvard Extension School as Data Scientist.
