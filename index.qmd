I am a data scientist at the [European Parliament](https://www.reneweuropegroup.eu/who-we-are/staff/marco-scipioni), mainly working on vote analysis, public opinion, and election campaigns. 
Previously, I worked for the [European Commission Knowledge Centre on Migration and Demography](https://knowledge4policy.ec.europa.eu/migration-demography_en).
Prior to EU institutions, I spent some years in [academia](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=WuJGLH0AAAAJ&hl=en), at [LSE](https://www.lse.ac.uk/government), [UCC](https://www.ucc.ie/en/government-and-politics/), and [Birkbeck](https://www.bbk.ac.uk/courses/postgraduate/politics). 

I have a BA and MA in Philosophy and Ethics, an MSc and PhD in Politics, and a Graduate Certificate as Data Scientist.
